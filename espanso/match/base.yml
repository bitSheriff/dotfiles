# espanso match file

# For a complete introduction, visit the official docs at: https://espanso.org/docs/

# You can use this file to define the base matches (aka snippets)
# that will be available in every application when using espanso.

# Matches are substitution rules: when you type the "trigger" string
# it gets replaced by the "replace" string.
matches:
  # Simple text replacement
  - trigger: ";espanso"
    replace: "Hi there!"

  # NOTE: espanso uses YAML to define matches, so pay attention to the indentation!

  # But matches can also be dynamic:

  # Print the current date
  - trigger: ";date"
    replace: "{{mydate}}"
    vars:
      - name: mydate
        type: date
        params:
          format: "%m/%d/%Y"






  ### just examples ###
  # - trigger: ":quote"
    # replace: "{{output}}"
    # vars:
    #   - name: output
    #     type: choice
    #     params:
    #       values:
    #         - "Every moment is a fresh beginning."
    #         - "Everything you can imagine is real."
    #         - "Whatever you do, do it well."
